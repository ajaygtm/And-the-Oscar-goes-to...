# And-the-Oscar-goes-to...

Even though we already know [the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8) to the "Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything", calculated by an enormous supercomputer named __Deep Thought__ over a period of 7.5 million years, it is not particularly helpful when it comes to an important question of all time.

> __"Who's gonna win the Oscar?"__
  
I thought of asking __Deep Thought"__. Well, you [know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucKnpvPaAeM).

So I took this project to predict the __90th Academy Awards winners (2018)__ with the help of machine learning algorithms.

# Data

The data used for the project are extracted/scraped from various public sites like wikipedia, IMDB, etc.
You can read further about it in the extract folder.

The categories considered for the project are:
* Best Picture
* Best Director
* Best Actor
* Best Actress
* Best Supporting Actor
* Best Supporting Actress


# Analysis:

* Data Cleaning 
* Preliminary Analysis 

[Both Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tJGk4ofc18).

The corresponding code and the jupyter notebook are provided in the analysis folder.

# Algorithms Used:

* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines
* XGBoost


# Results:
Viola! Here's my prediction for the [90th Academy Awards.](http://oscar.go.com/)


Award | Prediction | Movie | Winners? 
------| ---------- | ----- | ----------------
Picture | The Shape of Water | [The Shape of Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiA4B5Y63IQ) | :heavy_check_mark:

Okay. Now, [let's wait and see how my predictions turn out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_aQupiaCSA)


#### Note: I will update the "Winners" column once the results are announced. 



# Update:
_Updating the results on_ __March 5,2018__ _at_ __7.00 PM__ (__GMT__)

Well, well, well... Looks like [my predictions were spot-on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guVAeFs5XwE) The model got all the 6 categories correctly. 



# Future Ideas:

Even though the methodology and algorithm used in this project are sufficient enough to get an accurate prediction in the major categories, it can be further expanded. 

__Additional Categories:__ Screenplay, Animated Film, Documentary Film and so on.

__Additional Features:__ Chicago Critics Association Awards, Independent Spirit Awards, Eddie Awards and so on.

Feel free to comment or make suggestions.




### P.S: Only one thing remaining to do. Yea. [It's time to celebrate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyepdtx_UI4)
